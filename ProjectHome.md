It uses ASM (Active Shape Library) which is the state of the art.

The goal of the project is making face tracking library for those who has  no knowledge of computer vision nor image processing.

Its functions are followed.

1. Face Location Tracking.
> - It tracks the face of the user.
> - So you can use this information to make your application more interactive.

2. Face Distance Tracking
> - It tracks how far the face of the user is.
> - This information also can be used for interaction.

3. Facial Shape Tracking.
> - It tracks the Shape of the user's face.
> - This can be used for portrait, caricature and etc..

Since this is very early version, it might be slow.
If you have any suggestions, anything would be welcomed!
